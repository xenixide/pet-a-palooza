        <center><h3>Private Shelters</h3></center>
				<p style="color:black;">Non-profit, private shelters are a place many people go when they're interested in adopting 
                                a dog. All private shelter will ask you to fill out an doption application . Sometimes they
                                do this before you've met any pets and other times they don't have you do it nti you've selected 
                                a pet you'd like to adopt. The form may be long or short, it contains practical questions.
                                It is the process of the shelter to know more about you and your lifestyle, if you're lift in adopting
                                a pet they're making sure that the pet is in good condition.</p>

        <center><h3>Animal Control and Municipal Shelters</h3></center>
				<p style="color:black;">While some municipal shelters do a good in reuniting animals with their owners and even finding homes
                                for their strays, most do a poor job in this area. Granted, many municipal shelters aren't mandated to do
                                much more than reunite or kill, but even here many shelters fail to meet minimum standards. Why is this happening?
                                Because municipal shelters are generally under the administration of a large department, they tend to get the 
                                short end of both funding and stuffing. After all, a shelter administered by the steet and sanitation
                                department may come under the perview of a department head who knows about road maintainance but not about caring animals.</p>

        <center><h3>Rescue Groups</h3></center>
				<p style="color:black;">This group/organization is dedicated to pet adoption. This group take unwanted, abandoned, abused or stray pets to 
                                attempt to find a suitable homes for them. Many rescue groups are created by and run by volunteers, who take animals
                                into their homes and take care for them including training, playing, handling medical issues and solving behavior 
                                problems-until a suitable permanent home can be found. This personalization mens the adoption process can be more rigorous
                                and last longer than one at a shelter. Most rescue groups are run by volunteers, so it can take some time for them
                                to get back to you. The group may want to conduct a home visit before finalizing the adoption.</p>
